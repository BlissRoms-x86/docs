# Install in a Virtual Machine

This method is **incomplete**, a **work-in-progress**. Android in general does not run great in VMs, because they do not have the proper drivers. As such performance is greatly reduced if you use this method. Please only install Bliss OS in VMs for evaluation, and keep in mind that the performance exhibited by Bliss OS in such an environment is not a true representation of actual performance on bare metal. With that in mind, let's get started!
